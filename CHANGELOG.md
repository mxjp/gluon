+ **Breaking:** Replace `e` function with an element builder API.

## Gluon 15.1
+ Add new `trigger` API.

## Gluon 15.0
+ **Breaking:** Remove all shared globals & utilities. This also breaks interoperability with other major versions.
+ **Breaking:** Removed `lazy` and `trigger`.
+ **Breaking:** Removed `sequential` param from `watch`, `watchUpdates` and `effect`. Immediate recusrive side effects are now always unfolded into a sequence.
+ **Breaking:** Batches now also run immediate follow up side effects in the same batch until no more updates are queued.
+ **Breaking:** Batch processing now stops if an error occurs, but the linking between signals and unnotified dependants will remain.
+ Fix potential memory leak with signals that are never updated.
+ Improve batch stack memory usage.
+ Improve signal access tracking memory usage & performance.

## Gluon 14.3

+ Allow arbitrary values as content in the `e()` shorthand.

## Gluon 14.1
+ Add special `ref` attribute.

## Gluon 13.0
+ **Breaking:** Batches now run even if an error is thrown to prevent breaking unrelated signal cycles.
+ **Breaking:** Teardown hooks for the same `capture` or `captureSelf` call are now called in reverse order.
+ **Breaking:** If the function passed to `capture` or `captureSelf` throws an error, teardown hooks are now automatically called in reverse order and the error is re-thrown.

## Gluon 7.1
+ Add `Signal.active` property.
+ Add `isTracking` utility.

## Gluon 7.0
